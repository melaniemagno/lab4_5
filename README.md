I literally misunderstood the point of this task by accident, sorry teach. I was going off of the code provided in class and thought we had to make a blazor app. sO at first, i accidentally created a regular ol' console app, then realized it wasnt a blazor app, so i had to restart in a new app as a blazor app. Thenn we spoke in class about what expectations you had for the project, and I realized i needed to go a lot simpler than i was doing, so i restarted again. (as a console app). THEN had the *smart (i.e. not) idea to continue to try to do this in blazor, so back to the ol' project file i went. Then spoke to some other students and realized i was being dumb when i had to prioritize my other classes that had stuff due Tuesday and Wednesday, so back to the Console App we go. and here we are now. a Week later with the same issues as before \_O_/.

i was able to create 2 api get requests! one returns a list of the amiibos, but it is currently cutting it off after so long. Not yet sure how to adjust for that?
the 2nd get request i used included input from the reader to do a web api get request that requires a name of an amiibo to pull that amiibo from the api.
some issues i encountered with the 2nd request was that i forgot i needed to include the "?name=" in the api get request, once i figured that out, i was able to get it working easily
